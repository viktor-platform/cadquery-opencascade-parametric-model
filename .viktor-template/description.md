This application demonstrates how to use CadQuery, a parametric 3D CAD modelling framework based on the Open CASCADE Technology (OCCT) geometry kernel, in VIKTOR.

The primary objective of this app is to showcase VIKTOR's ability to handle complex geometries alongside those created with its native geometry module. This is accomplished by integrating an open-source Python library, [```CadQuery```](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), which enables the creation of parametric 3D CAD models and their export in high-quality CAD formats such as STEP, AMF, 3MF, and GLTF.

Key functionalities featured in this app include:
- Advanced parametric 3D modeling
- Enhanced visualization through Viktor's Geometry and Image views

This innovative application demonstrates the advanced capabilities of constructing intricate 3D models and schematics within Viktor.

The primary objective of this app is to showcase Viktor's proficiency in handling complex geometries alongside those created with its native geometry module. This is accomplished by integrating an open-source Python library, [```CadQuery```](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), which enables the creation of parametric 3D CAD models and their export in high-quality CAD formats such as STEP, AMF, 3MF, and GLTF.

Key functionalities featured in this app include:

    Advanced parametric 3D modeling
    Enhanced visualization through Viktor's Geometry and Image views

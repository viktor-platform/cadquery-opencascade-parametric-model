This sample app shows how to construct intricated 3D models and schematics from within Viktor.

The goal of this app is to show that Viktor can handle detailed geometries next to those constructed with its built-in geometry module. This is achieved by using an open-source python library ([```CadQuery```](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)), which allows us to build (parametric) 3D CAD models and output those in high qaulity CAD formats (STEP, AMF, 3MF and GLTF). 

The following functionalities are showcased in this app
- Parametric 3D modelling
- Viktor's Geometry & Image views
